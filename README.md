** Descriptive Analysis & Visualization:** [Click here to go to Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/AnalysisofHotelPerformanceandCustomerBehavior/Dashboard7?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
**Details:**  The data article comprises two datasets containing hotel demand data, specifically for a resort hotel (H1) and a city hotel (H2), both sharing a common structure with 31 variables, detailing 40,060 observations for H1 and 79,330 observations for H2.
**Skills:** Data Cleaning and Preprocessing, Descriptive Analysis, Visualization, Linear Regression Model, Decision Trees Model, Neural Networks Model.
**Technology:** Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Msatplotlib
**Goal:** The goal was to predict hotel Average Daily Rate (ADR) using three models (Linear Regression, Neural Network, and Decision Trees), and the results demonstrated varying predictive performance across the models.

### Texas Electricity Pricing Analysis
**Link:** [Click here to go to Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/TexasElectricityPricingAnalysisStory/Story1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) 
**Description:**  The dataset consists of 8 CSV files, including information on electricity prices, generation, grid load, and weather variables (temperature, humidity, wind) in Texas for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021.
**Skills:** Data Cleaning, Descriptive Analysis, Visualization
**Technology:** Tableau Prep, Tableau
**Goal:** The project aimed to examine the factors influencing electricity prices in the largest deregulated sector in Texas, revealing insights through Tableau analysis.
**Results:** The analysis uncovered patterns such as seasonal price peaks in August, consistent pricing during other months, and a significant price spike during the February 2021 winter storm. The data also highlighted correlations between temperature, load, and price fluctuations, emphasizing the impact of unexpected weather events on electricity demand and prices.
